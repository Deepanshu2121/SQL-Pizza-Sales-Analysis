🍕 Basic to Advanced SQL Project – Pizza Sales Analysis

This project showcases a full journey from basic to advanced SQL, using real-world Pizza Sales data to uncover insights, analyze performance, and demonstrate strong data analytics skills.
The goal of this project is to apply SQL concepts ranging from simple queries to advanced analytical techniques and convert raw sales data into meaningful business decisions.

🚀 Project Overview

In this project, I performed a detailed analysis of pizza sales, covering:
Sales trends
Revenue generation
Customer demand patterns
Product performance
Time-based trends (daily, monthly, hourly)

This project highlights my ability to write optimized SQL queries, work with structured data, and generate actionable insights.

Objectives : 
Basic:
Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
Identify the highest-priced pizza.
Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

Intermediate:
Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

Advanced:
Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

📊 Key Insights

Using SQL, I derived insights such as:
🍕 Top-selling pizzas by quantity and revenue
💰 Highest revenue-generating categories
🕒 Peak order hours and busiest days
📈 Cumulative revenue patterns over time
⭐ Most profitable pizza size & type
📉 Identification of slow-selling items

These insights help businesses improve menus, pricing strategies, promotions, and inventory planning.
